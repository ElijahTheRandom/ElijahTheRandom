I am Elijah!

I am an undergraduate Computer Science researcher at the University of Alabama in Huntsville specializing in trustworthy and generative artificial intelligence, with complementary work in robotics and autonomous systems. My recent research focuses on developing physically grounded methods for detecting and localizing AI-generated or AI-altered media. I am interested in how we can analyze and generate content in ways that improve reliability, transparency, and public trust in modern generative AI systems.

My Github is a fun time capsule of my projects through the years.
